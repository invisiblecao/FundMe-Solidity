# FundMe-Solidity

This Solidity code is simply a full version from [Blockchain tutorial](https://youtu.be/M576WGiDBdQ) lesson 3.

# Some Fixes

Since the tutorial was conducted in September 2021, some of the Faucets has already been removed from [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/), 
so we simply use another test network [**Goerli Testnet**](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=ethereum).
